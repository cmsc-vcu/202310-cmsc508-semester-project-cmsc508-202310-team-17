Problem Statement:
An organization needs to keep track of various soccer stats for club competitions across different leagues. Many complaints have come in from different sources, including the organization, coaches, and individual players about not having their specific needs being met. The organization has been struggling to keep track of stats and data spanning all of the different leagues they manage. The coaches need a system to track various stats for the team. Players have complained about not being able to know about more stats than just their own. Across the whole database there are five major entities; Player, Player Stats, Team, League, and Games. The attributes in Player are: Player ID, First Name, Last Name, Position, Jersey Number, Team Name. The attributes in Player Stats are: Player ID, Goals, Assists, and Saves. The attributes in Team are: Team Name and Seasonâ€™s Record. The attributes in League are: League Name, Team Names, and Records. The attributes in Games are: Match ID, Date, Score, Opponent, and Team Name.  

Uses of database:
This database can be utilized to help the organization better organize the leagues that they manage. Coaches can determine strengths and weaknesses throughout their team to help improve their team moving forward. Players will also be able to keep track of their individual stats and be able to compare themselves to others to see their personal standings more easily. 

Lessons learned:
What we would change for next time would be to work on it together more. Since our schedules opposed eachother it was hard for us to work together. 

How to improve semester project:
The only thing we could think of is giving soft deadlines to help students stay on track.
